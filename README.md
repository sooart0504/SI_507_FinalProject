### Created by Soo Ji Choi

### Project Summary
A personalized health intervention program that suggests exercise videos based on the user's affective state, logs and displays the userâ€™s overall affective state.

**Project Interaction Flow & Components**
* Program prompts for the user's current mood with a list of options
* User chooses their current mood
* Program saves the user input data into a database as an archive
  * All inputs are stored and saved to later view it as a data visualization
* Based on user input, the program identifies the user's affective state into a category that will be used to suggest a different types of exercise 
  * Positive emotion
    * Moderate to high intensity exercise
  * Neutral emotion
    *  Light intensity exercise
  * Negative emotion
    * Relaxation-focused exercise
* Then, the program suggests 3 youtube exercise video
  * If mood is negative, suggest relaxation exercise videos such as relaxation/breathing/meditation/yoga/stretching exercises
  * If mood is neutral, suggest light intensity exercise videos
  * If mood is positive, suggest moderate to high intensity exercise videos such as HIIT or cardio
* After the exercise video is suggested, user have several options:
  * User have the option to start exercise now (link to embedded youtube video)
  * View mood archive data
    * If requested to see archive data, program accesses the archive database of the recent 12 inputs, and plots the mood data into a plot (assuming the data was inputted by one user)
    * After displaying the data visualizations, the program has the option to start exercise or quit the program.
  * Quit the program

Data sources:
* Youtube Data API - used to search exercise videos
* SQLite Database with an archive of past user inputs
* Plotly - data visualization
